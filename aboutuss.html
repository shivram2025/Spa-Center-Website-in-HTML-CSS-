       <h2>About Us</h2>
       <p>OUR Center, founded in 1986, grew out of the Longmont Ministerial Association. 
         Church leaders realized that those in need were turning to the churches for help 
         that they were not always able to provide.  The churches agreed that uniting 
         community resources would give better help to those who needed it, and also give 
         the churches a consistent place to refer people.  Out of this 
        realization grew the Outreach United Resource Center, Inc. or OUR Center.</p>

        <p>OUR Center is truly a community-based agency.  While most of the churches in the St.
             Vrain Valley support OUR Center, it is not affiliated with any one church, or any 
             other agency. OUR Center works closely with many other agencies in
             the community to assist those in need, especially those in emergency situations.</p>
             <p>OUR Center consists of the Family Resource Center at 220 Collyer St. and Aspen 
                Center for Child Development at 501 5th Avenue in Longmont, CO.  This makes it
                 more efficient and convenient for our clients to receive services.  Once again, 
                 the St. Vrain Community has
                 come together to provide the highest quality assistance to those in need.</p>
                 <p>At the present time, administrative costs are less than 12% percent of the
                     total budget, and only a part of that administrative time is spent on raising funds. 
                      Our fundraising activity is carried on by a minimal Development staff,
                       volunteer Board of Director members and other volunteers in the community, 
                    thereby maximizing the services rendered from contributed dollars.</p>
                    <h2>OUR CENTER VISION</h2>
                    <p>We will be a recognized leader in transforming peopleâ€™s lives by joining them 
                        in reaching their personal potential.</p>
                        <h2>WHAT IS A FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER?</h2>
                        <p> Family Resource Center provides a safe, accessible place for families to connect with comprehensive,
                             coordinated services that help them strengthen their families and self-reliance. Programs are tailored to the
                              culture, resources and needs of our community.

                            Through the OUR Center, resource specialists work one-on-one with families 
                            to help them set and achieve transformative goals in their lives. The framework, 
                            a research-based approach known as the family development approach, focuses on
                             helping individuals and families build from their 
                            strengths, take charge of their lives, and access community resources.</p>
                            <p>Parenting programs and support groups complement the one-on-one work of 
                                the resource specialists, promote positive parenting skills, and prevent child abuse.
                                 Poverty reduction and financial literacy courses support families in managing 
                                 and strengthening their family finances. These programs
                                 use curricula that have shown strong evidence of success with families over time.</p>
                                 <p>By becoming a Family Resource Center, the OUR Center has gained access to additional resources
                                     such as learning opportunities for families, training opportunities for staff members, 
                                     collaborations with other Family Resource Centers and expanding partnership.

                                    The OUR Center is now a proud member of the Family Resource Center Association!
                                    
                                    For
                                     more information, contact Joni Lynch, Family Resource Manager</p>
